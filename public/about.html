<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an engineering student with a deep passion for both academics and creativity. I have always been 
  dedicated to my studies, reflected in my achievements of scoring 93.4% in my 10th grade
   and 85% in my 12th grade. 
  Learning and growing in this field excites me, 
  but there’s so much more to who I am beyond numbers and grades.</p>

  <p>Art has always been my escape and my expression. 
    I love painting—it allows me to put my emotions and imagination onto a canvas, 
    creating something that feels alive and personal. 
    Anime and series are a big part of my world too; 
    they inspire me with their stories, visuals, and characters, 
    often sparking ideas for my art or simply giving me moments of joy and reflection.</p>
  
  <p>Balancing these different parts of my life has taught me resilience and time management.
     I cherish the harmony of pursuing a technical career while nurturing my creative side. 
     It keeps me grounded and reminds me to enjoy the little things in life.
    I see myself as someone who thrives on curiosity and creativity. 
    Whether it’s solving an engineering problem, crafting a piece of art, 
    or immersing myself in a captivating story, I approach everything with passion and purpose.
     I hope to grow into someone who not only excels professionally
      but also inspires others through my creativity and enthusiasm for life.</p>
